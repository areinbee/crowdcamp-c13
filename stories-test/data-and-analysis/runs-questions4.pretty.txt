Feedback: I've played this game at summer camp with my campers.  We pick out a counselor who doesn't know the game, and tell them that we are going to come up with a story and that they will have yes or no questions to guess it.  Then we agree that all questions that end with a vowel -we answer no to...and all questions that end with a consonant  we answer yes to.    Good way to kill a half an hour.  Curious what you will do with this.  good luck;)
