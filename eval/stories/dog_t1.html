"A man and his dog decided to go on a trip to the beach by car. The man stopped at the gas station to fill up his tank and buy some snacks, however when he came out of the store he noticed that his dog was missing! The man went back into the store to ask if anyone had saw his dog, when he overheard a woman say that her son was missing as well.He went over to the woman and explained that his dog was missing, and suggested that they should team up to find them. The two of them found an off duty firefighter, but he was not much help.

Meanwhile, the dog had been chasing a pickup truck that had a giant beach ball in it until he had found himself hopelessly lost and separated from his owner. Ironically, he was a few miles away from the beach, as you might have guessed. The truck came to a halt and there were seagulls everywhere! He had made his way to the beach without his owner. The dog chased a sand crab until he accidentally bumped into a crying little boy. The boy was also lost, and belonged to the woman at the gas station. The boy kind of cheered up when he saw the dog, and promised that he would help him find his owner. The man and woman eventually came to the beach and found the boy and the dog. The boy and dog played together, and the man and woman went on a date. Sadly, the boy never saw the dog after that."
