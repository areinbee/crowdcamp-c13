Every afternoon the man sits on the same bench at the park. Every afternoon, the man sits there and waits. He waits for people to walk by, watch animals play, hear laughter, and stories to go by.
Every afternoon, the man chooses one character to focus on, to discover, to guess, and intrigue himself... but not this afternoon. Today the man could not help but split his attention on two of the most odd characters he had seen at the park. In the old man’s eyes these characters could be one, because to him it was clear, they did not belong in the park that day.
So there they were, at the very opposite end of the park. Under the shadows of the cherry blossoms was the boy, with his backpack hanging from one shoulder, a muddy pair of sneakers, and a half eaten peanut butter sandwich. Also, on the other side was a dog sprinting across the park. He was not just any dog but a pug, as small as a mouse but with a lion attitude chasing a ball the size of a boulder that was leading him to nowhere but trouble.

Just as the dog reached his very top speed, running with all his might he tripped over a hose, but not just any hose! Two firemen were busy putting out a blazing fire set by two teenagers experimenting with their latest circus trick, juggling flaming bowling pins! A story that the man regretted not to have followed! With tremendous bad luck, the dog hit the fire hose, flew into the air and made a crash landing into some hot ashes.  With a smoking, burning red tail he began speeding towards any source of water he can think of. He looked, and looked...and there it was, far - further than it had ever been, across the playground, rose garden, and the old people playing chess. Finally he saw, at the exact opposite end of the park, the precious water fountain.
When the pug, now a cheetah in his mind, reached the fountain another problem was waiting for him on this unlucky day. His teddy bear size is too short to make it to the ledge of the water. This water that could not be more desired in the middle of the desert. Water that seems fresher than the crystals of Antarctica. Water that right now seemed impossible to reach. Except for one thing, the boy.

The boy, still with this lost look, had not realized anything or anyone at the park that day.  The pug spotted the boy and used his best pug tail wag, cries, and charm to get the help of this this spaced out boy.  When the dogs tricks did not work, when he almost politely spoke to the boy! Just when the pug thought his tail was toast the kid turned his head and saw the sight of the poor dog.  He saw the smoking tail and swooped him up in one strong arm and just as he was about to save the day, he heard a loud startling voice from the other side of the street, “Nicholas!!!!” His mom shouted. With this scare he jumped up and landed face first in the water fountain. The dog was wet, cool and had never been happier. The kid was soaked with his backpack, school books, clothes, and sneakers. He knew he saved the day and was happily wet after such a fun episode. His mom was dry, but not certainly not happily dry.
After helping his son to get out, and giving an unpleasant lesson on the importance of following instructions to not get lost and upset moms, they carried the burnt and lost pug to the street addressed with his collar. There they met a little girl sitting down in a staircase, who stood up and met them energetically.  When she saw the dog, her dog, who was missing for hours that felt more like years, she smiled, she thanked them and knew she had found a new best friend in the boy.
