There was a fireman and his wife who had a son. His son had a dog. One day the dog and the boy were playing fetch with a tennis ball, when the boy threw the ball too far into the woods. The dog didn't come back and the boy got worried. He went into the woods after the dog and found the dog limping badly. He had cut his foot on a piece of glass. The boy used his t-shirt to bandage the dogs paw. Then he looked around and realized he didn't know where they were. They were lost! They huddled together for awhile and then the dog started limping away. The boy followed and eventually they found their way out of the woods. The boys mom and dad had been looking all over for them and were very relieved to see them walking out of the woods. They took the dog to the vet, where he had stitches in his paw.
