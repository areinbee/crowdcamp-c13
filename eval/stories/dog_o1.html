Bob walked down the path leading from his farm to the town. As he walked, he saw two small silhouettes against the horizon. As the sun dipped behind a cloud, he could see the silhouettes were actually a boy and a dog, walking up the road towards him.
</p>
<p>
As Bob walked, his mind was on other things - specifically his wife back at home. He loved his wife dearly, but they had just had an argument. Bob loved being a fireman, but his wife worried a lot about his safety.
</p>
<p>
Deep in thought, Bob watched as the silhouettes of the boy and the dog came closer. He could now see that the boy was tossing a ball in the air as he walked. Each time he tossed the ball, he saw the dog look up as though he wanted to catch it. However, each time the boy caught the ball as it fell.
</p>
<p>
Bob watched the two silhouettes as they continued to approach him. At one point, he noticed that the boy stopped tossing the ball long enough to kneel down on the ground beside the dog. Bob couldn't tell what was happening, but after a few minutes the boy got up and they continued walking.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Bob met up with the boy and the dog. Somehow Bob knew that something was wrong. He asked the boy, "Are you lost?" The boy answered, "Yes… and this dog that's been walking with me for the last mile or so seems to be lost, too." The boy continued, "A little while ago, the dog stepped on a thorn. I helped him by pulling the thorn out of his paw so that he could continue walking with me." 
</p>
<p>
Bob asked the boy, "How did you get lost?" The boy answered, "My mom and I are camping nearby. While she was cooking dinner over the campfire, I wandered off to play… and got lost. I know I haven't walked very far, so she must be close… but I can't seem to find her."

<p>
Just then Bob saw a cloud of dust appear down the dirt road. As he watched, the cloud of dust revealed a fast-moving car. The driver of the car started honking the horn. "Joshua, is that you?" yelled the lady driving the car. The boy answered, "Mom!" and ran towards the oncoming car. The boy hopped in the car, and they drove off together down the road.

Bob looked down, and noticed that the lost dog was still beside him. Bob breathed a heavy sigh, and then turned around to walk home. He was deep in thought about his beloved wife. Perhaps he could transfer to a desk job at the department, instead of worrying his wife by fighting fires. The dog continued to follow him, until he spotted the ball that the boy had dropped in his rush to become reunited with his mother. As Bob continued to walk towards home, he and the dog parted ways.
