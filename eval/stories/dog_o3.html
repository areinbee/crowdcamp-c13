The boy shifts uneasily as he eyes the bespectacled dog beside him. The dog seemed lost in thought, if dogs could do that, sitting very still and gazing across the lake on this fine Sunday morning. He could see that the silver pendant on the dog’s collar was engraved with the name Steve. The boy hesitates a little, and then softly whispers the dog’s name.
The dog recognizes the name, as he turns and regards the boy with curious eyes. Equally curious, the boy inches a little and reaches out to pat the dog. Unexpectedly, the dog moves next to him and welcomes the nuzzling the boy gives him. The boy laughs.

Two benches to the right, A man silently observes the boy and the dog. He figures that both the boy and the dog are lost. The dog was there first, he knew. He was admiring the sunrise on this very bench when the dog came out of nowhere and sat on the worn bench, seemingly waiting for its owner, but that was hours ago.  Much later, the boy came wandering, looking anxiously around for somebody apparently, until he noticed the dog. A dog, bespectacled at that, is truly difficult not to notice. The man smiles as the dog lays its head on the boy’s lap, as if it has been doing that forever. The boy seemed content, keeping very still as he gazes over the serene lake, as if nothing else matters.

Out of the corner of his eye, the man notices a woman hurriedly approaching the boy and the dog’s bench. She pulls the boy to his feet as the dog yelps, and the woman looked genuinely frightened. Scolding the boy for wandering off, she sobs while embracing the boy tight.  The boy then tries to explain to the mother that he was chasing after the ball but he got lost and found the dog instead.

The mother did not notice the dog until then. Looking around, she calls out to the man, asking him if he owns the dog. The man answers no. Hearing that, the boy then declares that he will help Steve find its owner.
The man knew then that the mother was not going to leave it at that, especially that the man was wearing his fireman uniform. The mother tries to get him to help them find the dog’s owner. He tells her that yes, he is a fireman, but he got off duty hours ago, and no, he cannot help them now as he is expecting his ex-wife to turn up any time now to drop off their daughter so he could spend the Sunday with her. The mother, visibly disappointed with the man’s refusal, takes the boy and the bespectacled dog Steve and leaves.
Minutes later, a squealing girl in pigtails approaches the man on the bench and jumps to his arms. Now this Sunday just became perfect, the man thinks to himself.
