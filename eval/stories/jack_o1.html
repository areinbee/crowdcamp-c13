Jack Lunsford was a physicist in his mid fifties, a very thin man working as a machinist in a large factory. I won’t bore you by telling you anything more about that factory. Jack never had enough money to take care of her lovely wife, Jane Chesterton. They often argued about having a child, Jane wanted to have one, but Jack knew they couldn’t afford it. Jack was madly in love with Jane and felt guilty because of her unhappiness. Jack loved Jane more than anything and felt guilty because he wasn’t able to support her. But Jane thought her life was boring as hell, the life Jack gave her wasn’t the life she wanted. During the first two years of their marriage, they were one of the happiest couples all around the city. But day after day Jane’s love to her husband weakened and soon she stopped loving Jack. Jane fell in love with Harry, a successful architect, who had been in love with Jane all of his life. Harry and Jack had a very rough fight because of Jane and many years had passed since they had met. But there’s one thing I haven’t told you about Jack’s life yet. During the work at the factory, Jack had a lot of time to think and he didn’t use all that time just to think of Jane. Once Jack had an idea of inventing a time machine, he didn’t tell it to anyone because his life was sad and funny even without it. Every day at the factory he was working on a formula, which could revolutionize the whole world. After finding the formula Jack became very silent, he only thought about his machine, he was working a day and night and finally he built the time machine in the cellar of the factory. He threw the working helmet and ran to Jane to share the joy. But she wasn’t alone. When Jack found her in Harry’s arms, he couldn’t think, he just took the gun out of the cupboard and tried to kill Harry, but Jane couldn’t let him die and she stood up to cover Harry. The bullet went through her neck. Jack had killed Jane. Harry couldn’t believe what he saw; he took his pistol and shot Jack before he even had a chance to reload. Jack was shot badly, but he could still walk. Suddenly he got an idea; he put down the gun and went out. He shouted: “Help me!” The car stopped, Jack said: “Hurry, get me to the hospital, I know the way!” Jack was dying. But the car was heading towards the factory. Jack got out of the car and went directly to the cellar; he turned on the time machine and went to the past, August 9th of 1891, the day Jack and Jane got married. Jack was unconscious when he reached the destination, but the sound of motor explosion woke him up. He was still in the factory, but the cellar looked much cleaner. Jack covered his wound with his left hand and went to the church where he was married. He was hardly breathing when the younger Jack saw him. The older Jack whispered: “Jack, we don’t have enough time, grab the pen and listen to me!”, and he revealed the formula.
