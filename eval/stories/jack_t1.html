Jack heads home to show his lovely wife the invention that he has slaved over for almost ten years.  At home, he hears noises coming from the bedroom, and to his horror, he finds his lovely wife Jane in bed with his nemesis, the evil genius Bart -- smoking cigarettes.

""How could you?"", says Jack.

""I'm sorry darling, but I love two men"", says Jane.

""No, I mean how could you smoke cigarettes in bed!"", say Jack.

At this point, Bart pulls a blaster from a hidden location and trains it on Jack.

""I will now read my manifesto and then I will blast you"", says Bart.

Jane attacks Bart and they roll off the bed.  The blaster comes loose and Jack picks it up.  

""Turn-about is fair play"", he says.

Jane now jumps on Jack and they stumble around.  Jack trips and they fall headfirst into the Fromageatron.

Later that evening, as Bart is hosting a meeting of the Evil-doers, a henchman remarks that the apparatives are quite tasty, if a bit bitter.

""Yes, I thought they might be a little too cheesy, but the go well with a nice Chardonnay."", says Bart."
