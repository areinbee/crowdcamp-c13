CrowdCamp Report: Exploring a Creative Design Space with a Crowd of Non-Experts
CrowdCamp Report: Generating Creativity with the Crowd
CrowdCamp Report: Crowdsourcing Creativity
CrowdCamp Report: StoryOracle: Crowd-Generated Creativity

For an unconstrained design problem like writing a fiction story or designing a poster,
can a crowd of non-experts be shepherded to generate a diverse collection of high quality ideas?  Can the crowd also generate the actual stories or posters?
With the goal of building crowd-powered creativity support tools, a group of us,
Paul Andr√© http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pandre/,
Kanya (Pao) Siangliulue,
Kathleen Tuite http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ktuite/,
Robin N. Brewer http://userpages.umbc.edu/~brewer3/,
Krzysztof Gajos http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/,
Yotam Gingold http://cs.gmu.edu/~ygingold/,
Kurt Luther http://www.kurtluther.com/,
set out to answer these questions.
We based our approach on a technique described by Keith Johnstone in his book "Impro: Storytelling and the Theatre" for extracting creativity from people who believe themselves to be uncreative. An uncreative person is told that a story is already prepared and he or she has merely to guess it via yes or no questions.  Unbeknown to the guesser, there is no story; guesses are met with a yes or no response, essentially randomly.  For example:
(1) Is it about CSCW? Yes
(2) Is it about crowdcamp? No
(3) Is it about a bitter rivalry? Yes
(4) ...
As questioning proceeds, a consistent story is revealed.

To evaluate the potential of this "StoryOracle" approach,
we ran a series of experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk:
(1) We extracted dozens of surprising and creative stories and poster designs using the technique.
(2) We generated variations on well-liked stories by showing part of the questions to a new participant and instructing them to continue guessing.
(3) We converted question-based stories into "normal" stories.
(4) We evaluated stories' quality.
(5) We devised domain-specific prompts for questioners, such as the setting, theme, and characters in a story.
Taken together, in the two days of CrowdCamp we managed to build the foundation for a crowd-powered tool to explore a creative design space, in an undirected or directed manner, and generate a variety of high quality artifacts.
